# Mathify
A user interface to type simple math which upon submission generate an output html file with the equations rendered in MATHML and animated using Typed.js

# Conventions
My code converter assume the user to know only a few custom conventions.Any user can usually use this interface without going through the hassles of learning a language. They only need to adhere to a few conventions which are - 
1. When typing pure text/string such as "The value of the equation is : " the user must enclose the text in #'s i.e #texthere #
2. Use of brackets must be done carefully. Always enclose the arguments of fractions,square roots,powers and any operators with proper brackets().
3. a^b means a raised to the power b.
4. All the additional symbols are provided in the tool box. You Just need to click on the buttons to get the symbol and then enter the required arguments
Upon submission an output file containing the required mathml code and mathjax library already linked to the page will be generated as a separate file. 

You can also play the math equations animation which uses typed.js with some modifications to provide user control over play,resume,pause,speed-up and speed-down features.

And Thats all that you need to get started!
